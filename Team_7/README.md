Exam-cheating-detection-using-AI-cameras
This project is an AI-driven exam cheating detection system using computer vision. It leverages YOLOv8 and head pose estimation to identify abnormal head movements and phone usage. Normal forward-facing posture is marked Non-Cheating, while looking around or using a phone is flagged as Cheating. Project Overview

This project presents an intelligent surveillance system that automatically monitors students during exams. Traditional human invigilation is inefficient, error-prone, and resource-intensive. Our solution uses deep learning–based head-pose estimation, eye-gaze tracking, and action recognition to detect suspicious behaviors in real-time.

The tool is designed for:

Examination halls Online proctored exams University/classroom surveillance Research in behavior detection
